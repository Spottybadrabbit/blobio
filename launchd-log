#
#  Synopsis:
#	Trivial help script to Log start/stop of process execed by launchd.
#  Usage:
#	launchd-log bin/flowd server etc/blobio.flow
#  Note:
#	No blobio daemon requires launchd-log.  The script is just a cheap
#	replacement for a more proper syslog facility.
#  Exit Status:
#	*	exit status of launched process
#  	127	unexpected error in launchd-log
#
